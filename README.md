# Cascading Avro

This is a fork of https://github.com/ScaleUnlimited/cascading.avro providing an updated library
supporting [Cascading 4.x](https://github.com/cwensel/cascading).

Note these artifacts are available on [GitHub packages](https://github.com/cwensel?tab=packages).

## cascading.avro-scheme

Cascading scheme for reading and writing data serialized using Apache Avro. This project provides several schemes that
work off an Avro record schema.

- AvroScheme - sources and sinks tuples with fields named and ordered according to a given Avro schema or a list of
  Fields and Types. If no schema is specified in a source it will peek at the data and get the schema. A sink schema is
  required (for now).

Avro Maps will be read in and converted to Java Maps. Avro Arrays will be read in and converted to Java Lists. In order
to use this feature you will need to provide Hadoop with a way to serialize Java Maps and Lists, such as cascading.kryo.

When writing to Avro an Avro Array can be made from either a Java List or a Cascading Tuple. The same applies for an
Avro Map. In the case of a Map, the incoming Cascading Tuple will be taken two entries at a time, the first will be the
key for the Avro Map and the second will be the value.

The current implementation supports all Avro types including nested records. A nested record will be written as a new
Cascading TupleEntry inside the proper Tuple Field. To write a nested record to Avro you must provide a TupleEntry with
proper field names.

The current version of cascading.avro is compatible with Cascading 4.x.

## cascading.avro-maven-plugin

An Apache Maven plugin that generates classes with field name constants based on an Avro record schema. This plugin
is similar to the standard Avro schema plugin used to generate specific objects for Avro records. The plugin creates
names for generated classes by appending the word "Fields" to the record name. The generated class will have constant fields
for all record fields, as well as a field named ALL that lists all fields in the expected order.

The advantage of using the plugin is that given an Avro record Foo with field bar, you can use FooFields.BAR rather than 
the string "bar" in your Flow. Also it adds FooFields.ALL which lists all fields in the record, which is helpful as the
last step of an assembly to ensure you're producing all fields.
